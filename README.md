# Traffic Light Monitor

## About

Congestion is everywhere, especially in big cities and there is still a lot of idle time on traffic with
a time algorithm,

By creating a traffic management system based on density, it will reduce congestion and idle
time. So, it will have an impact on the smooth flow of traffic. How does it work? By utilizing
object detection installed at red lights, it is hoped that it will have a positive impact on road
users.

Traffic Light Monitor is an application that used to monitor traffic lights.

Traffic Light Monitor is a creation from Alien Squad (B21-CAP0442 Bangkit Team) released under the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE v3.
